# About Me

Nitzan - Nee-tsun

Soy milk lover, proud Prius driver (ask me about my gas mileage!), Electrical Engineering student, among other things. Dog person, despite the flashy feline appearance of this website. 

I place immense value on supporting the longevity of the life around us and it's important to me that the work I do contributes to the positive progression of humanity, earth, and the world beyond! I'm interested in nuclear fusion and the science/engineering behind recreating extreme environments.
